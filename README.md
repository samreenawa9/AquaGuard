ðŸŒŠ Water Waste Collector Boat ðŸš¤ | IoT-Based Autonomous Waste Collection System
This project is an IoT-enabled autonomous boat designed to collect floating waste from water bodies such as lakes, ponds, and rivers. The goal is to address water pollution using smart, automated, and sustainable technology.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
Autonomous Navigation: The boat can navigate itself using sensors and GPS.

Obstacle Detection: Equipped with ultrasonic sensors to avoid collisions.

Real-Time Location Tracking: Utilizes a NEO-6M GPS module to track and log boat movement.

Waste Collection System: Conveyor belt system collects and stores floating debris.

Load Monitoring: Load sensors monitor the amount of collected waste.

Wireless Communication: NRF24L01 module for remote data transmission and control.

Eco-Friendly Design: Runs on battery-powered brushless DC motors for minimal environmental impact.

ðŸ§  Technologies & Components Used
NodeMCU (ESP8266/ESP32) â€“ Microcontroller for IoT control

NEO-6M GPS Module â€“ Real-time location tracking

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors â€“ Obstacle avoidance

Brushless DC Motors â€“ Propulsion system

L298N Motor Driver â€“ Motor control

LiPo Battery Pack â€“ Power supply

Conveyor Belt System â€“ Waste collection mechanism

Load Sensor â€“ Waste load monitoring

NRF24L01 Module â€“ Wireless communication

ðŸ“¦ How It Works
The boat autonomously navigates the water using GPS coordinates and avoids obstacles with ultrasonic sensors.

Floating waste is gathered using a front-mounted conveyor belt.

Load sensors track the amount of waste collected and can send alerts when the storage is full.

The GPS and sensor data can be transmitted wirelessly to a remote dashboard for real-time monitoring.

ðŸŒ± Objective
To contribute to environmental sustainability by developing a cost-effective, smart system that reduces manual labor and efficiently collects water waste.

ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
Integration of a camera module for live video streaming and AI-based waste detection.

Solar panels for energy efficiency.

Mobile app interface for remote monitoring and control.
